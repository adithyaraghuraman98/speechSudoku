# Speech Sudoku
Welcome to speech sudoku. This project aims to simulate a sudoku puzzle by using user speech as input.

# What the project does
Welcome to speech sudoku. This simple interactive game takes in user speech as input. The game then processes the input to set up the sudoku board. Once this is done the user can continue playing the game using the keyboard.
If the user wishes to view the solution to the board, all they need to do is press the 's' key during the game and the solution to the board will be computed and then be displayed on-screen.
